        Donation is not only focused on red blood, but there are other components in the blood that can be donated including:
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>'Whole blood' donation</b>
        <br>
        Blood contains the following components:
        <ol class="roman">
         <li>Red blood cells</li>
         <li> White blood cells</li>
         <li> Platelet</li>
         <li> Plasma</li>
       </ol>
       Blood is needed for surgical cases, accident victims, treating patients with leukemia, cancer, thalassemia, heart disease,
       complications of bleeding during childbirth, haemophilia and others. The volume of blood that is usually donated is 450ml
       which is less than 1 pint of blood (568ml). The amount of blood taken is based on weight.
       <br>
       <br>
       The time taken to donate blood is between 7 to 10 minutes but you are advised to be at the donation site for about 1 hour.
       Before donating blood you are advised to take some food as a stomach pad. Donated red blood takes 4 - 8 weeks to be replaced
       while plasma takes 24 hours.
       <br>
       <br>
       <b>Apheresis donation</b>
       <br>
       Donation of blood components such as plasma or platelets or both, where unnecessary blood components are returned to the donor's body.

  With regard to the law of donating blood, it is circumcision and is encouraged mainly because it can provide assistance to patients
  in need in desperate situations. This is in line with the words of Allah SWT:
<center><b>"And help one another to do good and be pious." (Surat al-Ma'idah: 2) </b></center>
<br>
Sheikh al-Maraghi said: Therefore, human beings are obliged to help each other in matters that lead to goodness.
The help is either between individuals or society, in matters of worldly life or the afterlife. (See <b>Tafsir al-Maraghi,</b> 3/1474)
<br>
<br>
Likewise, this includes helping our fellow believers in distress. The words of the Prophet SAW are true:
<br>
<br>
<center><b>"If any man despise the commandment of the Lord from the beginning of the world, let not God destroy him with a rod of iron."
  Muslim History (2699)</center></b>
<br>
Whoever alleviates one of the hardships of a believer in the world, then Allah will alleviate one of his hardships on the Day of Judgment.
God’s test of man is a test for all of us. How is our attitude to help our brothers so that in this hadith mentions two parables of either
helping and also facilitating our other brothers. This is the nature of a true Muslim who always helps his other brothers whether with property,
body, energy, mind and others. (See <b>al-Kafi Syarah Hadith 40</b>, p. 337)
<br>
<br>
Even in the same hadith, it is connected with the sentence:
<br>
<br>
"And God was in the land of the living, and the land was in the land of his father." Muslim History (2699)
<br>
<br>
God helps a servant as long as the servant helps his brother. Furthermore, the recent need for blood by patients in hospitals and clinics is
extremely critical and desperate. Therefore, donating blood is one of the things that is needed by the National Blood Center. We sincerely hope
that the sense of humanity and compassion in the community will grow fresh to donate blood to those in need.
<br>
<br>
Included here some decisions and fatwas from leading bodies and scholars, including:
<br>
<br>
<ul style="list-style-type: none; margin: 0; padding: 0;"}>
<li><b>Muzakarah Jawatankuasa Fatwa Majlis Kebangsaan Bagi Hal Ehwal Ugama Islam Malaysia Kali Ke-4</b></li>
<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">The Muzakarah which was convened on 13-14 April 1982 discussed Blood Donation and the
  Use of Muslim Blood to Non-Muslims and vice versa. Muzakarah has decided that:
<ol class="roman">
 <li>Donating blood is legal</li>
 <li>There is no need to separate the blood of Muslims from the blood of non -Muslims</li>
 <li>Appreciation in the form of payments to blood donors is discouraged</li>
</ol></p>

<li><b>Fatwa of Sheikh Muhammad bin Ibrahim Alu al-Sheikh, former Chairman of Hai'ah Kibar Ulama 'Sa'udi</b></li>
<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">He mentioned: Should donate blood as long as it does not harm the donor when there is a need to help Muslims in need.
Second, should build a blood bank to be kept for the needs of those who wish. </p>

<li><b>Sheikh Muhammad Mutawalli Sya'rawi, a leading commentator and scholar of Egypt</b></li>
<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">He said: "Blood donation obliges a person to get a reward from Allah SWT."</p>

<li><b>Sheikh Hasanain Makhluf, former Mufti of Egypt</b></li>
<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
  In the book <i>
Fatawa Syar'iyyah wa Buhuth Islamiyyah,</i> he explained the law of transferring human blood to other human beings for medicine as follows:
<br>
<br>
Blood that flows even though it is haram in terms of Shari'ah based on the text of the Qur'an, but an emergency that forces you to seek medical
treatment or treat with the blood, then it is obligatory to take advantage of it. It is for medicine or treatment with it transferred from one
person to another (patient), when recognized by a Muslim doctor and expert in this matter.
<br>
<br>
All fuqaha 'require treatment or medicine with haram and najis things. It is when there are no pure things (medicines), when a Muslim expert thinks
this is critical, then the law is to do so according to sharia.</p>

<li><b>Sheikh Dr. Yusuf al-Qaradhawi</b></li>
<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">He noted that donating blood is one of the most important forms of charity nowadays.
  Because blood donors in this context not only help, but have reached the point of saving someone's life. So the value is very high on
  the side of Allah SWT. It even saves human lives that if not helped will die, yet with the blessing of donating blood this allows the
  continuation of one’s life, and it is described as giving life to all human beings.
<br>
<br>
The words of Allah SWT:</p>

<center><b>"And where he rests, so we dwell in the whole human race." (Surat al-Ma'idah: 32)</center></b>

<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
  And whoever takes care of the safety of a human life, then it is as if he has taken care of the safety of all human life. </p>

<li><b>Sheikh Dr. Ali Jumu'ah, former Mufti of Egypt</b></li>
<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
He said: If donating blood can save another person from death, and experts say it does not cause a negative impact on the donor, whether on his physical,
life or work, then it is permissible. This ability includes the Islamic permission to save human souls which must be preserved, as commanded by Allah.
This donation can even be categorized as a sacrifice and an attitude of putting the interests of others first ( ithar ) which is encouraged by Allah SWT:</p>

<center><b>"and they also prefer the emigrants more than themselves, even if they are in a <br> state of deprivation and desperate." (Surat al-Hashr: 9)</b></center>

<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">This problem can also be compared to the ability to rescue people who are drowned, trapped by fire and buried in rubble even though there is a risk of death
for the person who rescues them. </p>

<li><b>Sheikh Zaid bin Muhammad al-Madkhali</b></li>
<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
He explained: When there is maslahat in him and does not cause harm that can harm himself, then donating blood is not prohibited but instead gets rewards
and advantages, as enshrined in the book of Allah and the sunnah of His Messenger. Allah SWT says: </p>

<center><b>"Wherefore he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever." (Surah al-Zalzalah: 7-8)</center></b>

<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">So whoever does good as much as a particle, he will see it (in his deed) and whoever does evil as much as an atom's weight, he will see it too.
<br>
<br>
Rasulullah SAW also said:</p>

<center><b>"And God was in the land of the living, and the land was in the land of his father." <br>Muslim History (2699)</center></b>

<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">God helps a servant as long as the servant helps his brother. </p>

<li><b>Sheikh Dr. Husamuddin bin Musa 'Ufanah</b></li>
<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
He said donating blood was a very important practice to do. Donating blood is a sunnah practice. In fact, he stated that it is not an exaggeration
to say that the law of donating blood reaches the law of fardhu kifayah. </p>

Blood donation is not only beneficial for the society but also helps the donor to maintain good health.
The health benefits of donating blood are mentioned below:
          <ul style="list-style-type: none; margin: 0; padding: 0;"}>
          <li><b>Prevents Hemochromatosis</b></li>
          Health benefits of blood donation include reduced risk of hemochromatosis. Hemochromatosis is a health condition that arises due to
          excess absorption of iron by the body. This may be inherited or may be caused due to alcoholism, anemia or other disorders. Regular
          blood donation may help in reducing iron overload. Make sure that the donor meets the standard blood donation eligibility criteria.
          <br>
          <br>
          <li><b>Anti-Cancer Benefits</b></li>
          Blood donation helps in lowering the risk of cancer. By donating blood the iron stores in the body are maintained at healthy levels.
          A reduction in the iron level in the body is linked with low cancer risk.
          <br>
          <br>
          <li><b>Maintains Healthy Heart & Liver</b></li>
          Blood donation is beneficial in reducing the risk of heart and liver ailments caused by the iron overload in the body. Intake of iron-rich
          diet may increase the iron levels in the body, and since only limited proportions can be absorbed, excess iron gets stored in heart, liver,
          and pancreas. This, in turn, increases the risk of cirrhosis, liver failure, damage to the pancreas, and heart abnormalities like irregular
          heart rhythms. Blood donation helps in maintaining the iron levels and reduces the risk of various health ailments.
          <br>
          <br>
          <li><b>Weight Loss</b></li>
          Regular blood donation reduces the weight of the donors. This is helpful to those who are obese and are at higher risk of cardiovascular
          diseases and other health disorders. However, blood donation should not be very frequent and you may consult your doctor before donating
          blood to avoid any health issues.
          <br>
          <br>
          <li><b>Stimulates Blood Cell Production</b></li>
          After donating blood, the body works to replenish the blood loss. This stimulates the production of new blood cells and in turn, helps in
          maintaining good health.
        </ul>

           <li><b>The organizers are requested to provide: </b></li>
           At least 8 tables and 20 chairs for the use of donors and staff on duty (depending on the number of donors) Fans-if the place provided
           is not air-conditioned or open. Electricity and clean water supply.
           <br>
           <br>
           <li><b>Publicity</b></li>
           <br>
           <li><b>Posters and pamphlets</b></li>
           for the publicity of this blood donation campaign will be provided by the PDN. The organizers are recommended to announce to  the public
           about the blood donation campaign that will be conducted using the poster provided at least a week before  the campaign date. On the day
           of the donation, an announcement orally or with the help of a public notification system (PA system) can be made to  remind the public about
           the ongoing campaign.
